Vue from scratch
================

This is Webpack + Vue 3 + Typescript setup I did from scratch, following official docs, for learning purposes (without vue-cli).

### Notes on package versions:
```
npm install vue@next
npm install -D vue-loader@next @vue/compiler-sfc
npm install vue-router@next
```

### Note on Typescript
Typescript definitions for Vue (shims.d.ts) taken from vue-cli generated project. They aren't documented anywhere in Vue docs.

### Note on index.html
Code taken from [html-webpack-plugin repo](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin#writing-your-own-templates). It is not documented in Webpack docs.
